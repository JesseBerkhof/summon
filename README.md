# Summon
With this package you'll be able to generate boilerplate packages for your project right from the command line.

## Installation
Add the repository to your `composer.json` file:

```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/jesseberkhof/summon.git"
    }
],
```

Install the package via composer:
```
$ composer require jesseberkhof/summon
```
For development it's best to symlink the packages. By default we will store the packages in `/packages`,
so make sure to add the following lines to `composer.json` to enable symlinking:

```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "packages/*",
        "symlink": true
    }
]
```

The config file can be published with:
```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JesseBerkhof\Summon\SummonServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## Usage

Create a new package with the following command:
```
$ php artisan summon [PACKAGE NAME]
```

You will be asked a couple of questions to set some author details and the namespace for your package.
Some of these values can be added to the config file so they will be set by default:

```php
return [
    'path' => 'packages', // Your packages will be stored here.
    'replacements' => [
        'author_email' => 'you@domain.com',
        'author_name' => 'Jane Doe',
        'author_role' => 'Developer',
        'package_description' => 'This package has been auto-generated by Summon',
        'namespace' => 'JesseBerkhof',
    ],
    'files' => [
        '/README.MD',
        '/CHANGELOG.md',
        '/composer.json',
        '/src/config/package.php',
        '/src/ClassName.php.stub',
        '/src/ClassNameFacade.php.stub',
        '/src/ClassNameServiceProvider.php.stub',
    ]
];
```

Require your package like so:
```
$ composer require [namespace]/[package_name]
```

ðŸŽ‰ That's it. With symlink enabled you should be ready to go with developing new Laravel packages within your project in no time.
